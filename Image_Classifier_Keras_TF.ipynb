Moreover, the validation curves are quite close to the training curves, which means that there is not too much overfitting. In this particular case, the model performed better on the validation set than on the training set at the beginning of training: this sometimes happens by chance (especially when the validation set is fairly small). However, the training set performance ends up beating the validation performance, as is generally the case when you train for long enough. You can tell that the model has not quite converged yet, as the validation loss is still going down, so you should probably continue training. Itâ€™s as simple as calling the fit() method again, since Keras just continues training where it left off (you should be able to reach close to 89% validation accuracy)."

Once you are satisfied with your modelâ€™s validation accuracy, you should evaluate it on the test set to estimate the generalization error before you deploy the model to production. You can easily do this using the `evaluate()` method (it also supports several other arguments, such as `batch_size` or `sample_weight`, please check the documentation for more details):"
